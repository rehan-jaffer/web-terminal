HTML5/Ruby WebSocket Terminal

This is a simple implementation of a websocket server with a pseudoterminal input. You type into the terminal and press enter, the server written in Ruby using Faye responds. Currently the server does nothing except reverse the text and send it back. Collusus-like sound effects and extra functionality will be implemented soon.
